I am a co-founder & the Bitcoin Lead Dev at PISA Research. I got my PhD in CS from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) focusing on Bitcoin and Distributed Systems. In the past I have worked in the blockchain laboratories at both UCL and UIUC. My recent research has focused on measuring (and inferring) the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network which was presented at Financial Cryptography (18 & 19) and Scaling Bitcoin (18 & 19). Currently building a Watchtower protocol for Bitcoin.
