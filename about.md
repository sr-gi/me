I am a Bitcoin dev and researcher at <a class='link' href='https://chaincode.com'>Chaincode Labs</a>. Before that, I worked on an implementation agnostic watchtower for The Lightning Network called <a class='link' href='https://github.com/talaia-labs/rust-teos'>The Eye of Satoshi</a>. In the past, I co-founded and leaded the Bitcoin development at <a class='link' href='https://pisa.watch'>PISAResearch</a>. I got my PhD in CS from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) focusing on Bitcoin and Distributed Systems. In the past I have worked in the InfoSec groups at both UCL and UIUC. My recent research has focused on measuring (and inferring) the Bitcoin and Lightning peer-to-peer network which was presented at Financial Cryptography (18 & 19 & 21) and Scaling Bitcoin (18 & 19).
